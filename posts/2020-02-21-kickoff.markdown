title: Let's get the can rolling

I've been thinking about putting some of my experiences as a software dev to paper for way to many years.
In the effort of getting stuff done before I kick the bucket: no more excuses, no more getting things perfect.

This will be raw and wrong and opinionated but at least it will be there. And maybe someone finds it useful.
